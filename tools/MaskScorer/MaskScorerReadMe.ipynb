    "This script calculates performance scores that measure the accuracy of a system output mask to a reference mask.

    "In the following metrics, the following terminology is used:\n",
    " * $GT$ refers to the ground truth mask\n",
    " * $sys$ refers to the system output mask\n",
    " * $TP$ refers to True Positives computed between the ground truth mask and the system output\n",
    " * $TN$ refers to True Negatives computed between the ground truth mask and the system output\n",
    " * $FN$ refers to False Negatives computed between the ground truth mask and the system output\n",
    " * $FP$ refers to False Positives computed between the ground truth mask and the system output\n",
    " * $weights$ is a matrix of 1's and 0's that denotes the set of pixels scored by the system; it is generated by a difference in the erosion and dilation of the manipulated area of $GT$.\n",

    "$\\Sigma_{px \\in GT}$ refers to the sum over the pixels in the ground truth that are marked black. $c$ denotes a minimum cutoff value for the scoring to have any meaning; by default, $c=-1$.\n",

    "### Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "MCC(GT,sys) = \\frac{TP*TN - FP*FN}{\\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "An MCC of 1 denotes perfect correlation, an MCC of 0 denotes no correlation at all, and an MCC of -1 denotes perfect anti-correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted L1 Loss (WL1)\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "WL1(GT,sys,weights)=\\frac{(FP+FN)_{weights > 0}}{\\Sigma weights(px)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "A Weighted L1 of 0 denotes perfect or near perfect match up to variation within the weights that are 0; 1 denotes perfect mismatch. $(FP+FN)_{weights > 0}$ refers to the total number of $FP$ and $FN$ pixels where weights are greater than 0."
