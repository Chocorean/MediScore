BASIC FUNCTIONALITY validated.

Beginning experiment ID naming error validations. Expect ERROR printouts for the next couple of cases. This is normal here.
CASE 0: Validating behavior when files don't exist.
ERROR: I can't find your system output emptydir_NC2016_Splice_ImgOnly_p-baseline_1/foo__NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-baseline_1.csv! Where is it? 
CASE 0 validated.

CASE 1: Validating behavior when detecting consecutive underscores ('_') in name...
ERROR: What kind of task is NC2016? It should be Manipulation or Removal! 
The name of the file is not valid. Please review the requirements. 
CASE 1 validated.

CASE 2: Validating behavior when detecting excessive underscores elsewhere...
ERROR: What kind of task is NC2016? It should be Manipulation or Removal! 
The name of the file is not valid. Please review the requirements. 
CASE 2 validated.

CASE 3: Validating behavior when detecting '+' in file name and an unrecognized task...
ERROR: The team name must not include characters + or _ 
ERROR: What kind of task is Manip? It should be Manipulation or Removal! 
The name of the file is not valid. Please review the requirements. 
CASE 3 validated. Validating syntactic content of system output.

CASE 4: Validating behavior for incorrect headers, duplicate rows, and different number of rows than in index file...
ERROR: Your header(s) Fileid, OutputMaskFName should be ProbeFileID, ProbeOutputMaskFileName respectively. 
ERROR: Your system output contains duplicate rows for ProbeFileID's: NC2016_5847 at row(s): 5 after the header. I recommended you delete these row(s). 
ERROR: The number of rows in the system output does not match the number of rows in the index file. 
The contents of your file are not valid! 
CASE 4 validated.

CASE 5: Validating behavior when mask is not a png...
ERROR: Mask image bar_NC2016_Removal_ImgOnly_p-baseline_1/mask/foo.jpg for FileID NC2016_7432 is not a png. Make it into a png! 
ERROR: The contents of your file are not valid! 
CASE 5 validated.

CASE 6: Validating behavior when mask is not single channel and when mask does not have the same dimensions.
Dimensions for ProbeImg of ProbeFileID NC2016_7432: 3744,5616 
Dimensions of mask baz_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-baseline_1/mask/bar.png: 480,640 
ERROR: The mask image's length and width do not seem to be the same as the base image's. 
ERROR: Mask image baz_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-baseline_1/mask/bar.png of ProbeFileID NC2016_7432 should be single-channel. 
ERROR: The contents of your file are not valid! 
CASE 6 validated.

CASE 7: Validating behavior when system output column number is not equal to 3.
ERROR: The number of columns of the system output file must be equal to 3. Are you using '|' to separate your columns? 
CASE 7 validated.

CASE 8: Validating behavior when mask file is not present.
ERROR: foo_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-baseline_4/mask/foo.png does not exist! Did you name it wrong? 
ERROR: The contents of your file are not valid! 
CASE 8 validated.

All validation runs complete.
